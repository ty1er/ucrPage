I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/).
I am a member of [UCR Database lab](http://dblab.cs.ucr.edu/) advised by [Vassilis J. Tsotras(UCR)](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/) and [Michael J. Carey (UCI)](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~mjcarey/). My research interests are in the area of databases and distributed systems.

Prior to coming to UCR I received CS degree from [Ufa State Aviation Technical University](http://ugatu.ac.ru/) in June 2011.
