I have successfully defended my PhD thesis in June 2018! After my graduation have started a new job at Google in [Spanner SQL](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056103) team in Kirkland. Please see my new [website](https://ty1er.github.io/) for updates.
Prior to completion of my degree I was a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/).
I was a member of [UCR Database lab](http://dblab.cs.ucr.edu/) advised by [Vassilis J. Tsotras(UCR)](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/) and [Michael J. Carey (UCI)](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~mjcarey/). My research interests are in the area of databases and distributed systems.

Before to coming to UCR I received CS degree from [Ufa State Aviation Technical University](http://ugatu.ac.ru/) in June 2011.
