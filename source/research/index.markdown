* [AsterixDB](http://asterix.ics.uci.edu/)

AsterixDB is a new, full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a feature set that set it apart from other Big Data platforms in todayâ€™s open source ecosystem. Its features make it well-suited to applications including web data warehousing, social data storage and analysis, and other uses related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexible NoSQL style data model; a query language that supports a wide range of queries, a scalable runtime; partitioned, LSM-based data storage and indexing (including B+ tree, R tree, and text indexes); support for external as well as native data; a rich set of built-in types, including spatial, temporal, and textual types; support for fuzzy, spatial, and temporal queries; a built-in notion of data feeds for ingestion of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store.
